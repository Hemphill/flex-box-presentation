# Flex-Box Presentation

## Setup

I've included all the dependancies, so their is no setup required other than downloading this project.

## Viewing the Presentation

Simply open the `presentation/index.html` file in your favorite web browser (tested in Safari & Chrome). 

To navigate the slides use the arrow keys on your keyboard or click on the arrows in the lower right corner of each slide.
